## Folder synchronization with python
Please implement a program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The
program should maintain a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder.
Solve the test task by writing a program in one of these programming languages:

Python<br>
C/C++<br>
C#<br>

-Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source folder;<br>

-Synchronization should be performed periodically.<br>

-File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output;<br>

-Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments;<br>

-It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization;<br>

-It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorithms. For example, there is no point in implementing yet another function that calculates MD5 if you need it for the task â€“ it is perfectly acceptable to use a third-party (or built-in) library.
